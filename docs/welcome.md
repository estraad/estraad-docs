## Communication {#communication}
### Microphone {#microphone}
Microphone voice communication is the primary form of communication inside a room.

Like in real life, the distance between you and other avatars will affect how well you hear them. Get closer to others to hear them better.
When speaking, the avatar’s mouth will move and the users nametag will become green to indicate who is speaking.

You can enable and disable your microphone by clicking the microphone button in the middle on the bottom of your screen.




:::note

It is best practice to mute your microphone when not in use. This will reduce unnecessary noise and feedback in the room.

:::

### Chat {#chat}
You can also communicate with others by messages.

Use the text field in the bottom left corner of the interface (With the placeholder “Chat with the room…”) to write your message. Hit “ENTER” to send the message to the room.

Your message will appear to everyone in the room for 50 seconds before fading out.


### Raise Hand {#raise-hand}
You can raise your hand to get other peoples attention. Click the Raise Hand button and a hand icon will appear above your characters head.

The hand icon will also show in the user list.
