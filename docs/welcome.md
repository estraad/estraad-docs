## Navigation
### Movement
Use your arrow keys or the WASD-keys to move around.
You can hold SHIFT while moving for a speed boost.

### Looking
Turn your head by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button.
If you find rotating with the mouse difficult, you can also use Q and E to rotate 45 degrees left and right respectively.


## Communication
### Microphone
Microphone voice communication is the primary form of communication inside a room.
Like in real life, the distance between you and other avatars will affect how well you hear them. Get closer to others to hear them better.
When speaking, the avatar’s mouth will move to indicate who is speaking.
You can enable and disable your microphone by clicking the microphone button in the middle on the bottom of your screen.

It is best practice to mute your microphone when not in use. This will reduce unnecessary noise and feedback in the room.
### Chat communication
You can also communicate with others by messages.

Use the bottom left field “Send to room…” to write your message. Hit “ENTER” or click the send button to chat with others via messages.


Your message will appear to everyone in the room for 50 seconds before fading out.
