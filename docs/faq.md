#### I am not getting an email when I try to log in.

Please give the system up to 5 minutes to deliver email. Check your spam folder too.

If you are joining a custom event on a URL different from meet.estraad.com, the event manager might have enabled whitelisting. Whitelisting means you will not receive an email unless you are pre-approved. In this case, please contact the person responsible for the event.

#### The website is white

Try loading the page using incognito (private) tab. If that does not work, contact support.

If incognito tab works, clear your cookies as instructed here:

#### I cant control volume in videos

This is a known issue for the Safari browser. Please use one of the recommended browsers as described in [welcome](welcome.md). Also a known issue for connecting with a mobile phone.

#### Loading the website says the device is not supported

Unfortunatley running a 3D environment in the browser means we have limited support for older devices and browsers. If you get this message, make sure you are using one of our supported brwosers as described in [welcome](welcome.md). You need to be using a relatively modern (2013++) computer (or iPad, iPhone, etc) and a modern operating system such as Mac OS, Windows 10, or GNU/Linux with a browser environment supporting WebGL.
