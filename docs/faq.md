Please give the system up to 5 minutes to deliver email. Check your spam folder too.

If you are joining a custom event on a URL different from meet.estraad.com, the event manager might have enabled whitelisting. Whitelisting means you will not receive an email unless you are pre-approved. In this case, please contact the person responsible for the event.

#### I am getting kicked out of the room after a short amount of time {#i-am-getting-kicked-out-of-the-room-after-a-short-amount-of-time}

From our experience this is due to network restrictions.

You may need to try another network, or ask your company/organization IT support for the following:
 
Help use a VPN to avoid restrictions
 
Configure the company network/firewall to:
- Allow for WebSocket connections
- Allow for ports 80 and 443 via TLS. 
- Allow for ports 49152-60999 on UDP and TCP.  You will also need to open port 19302 on UDP and TCP.

Make sure your computer audio settings are set properly. Estraad is a normal website, and cannot configure your audio output. Test on other websites and make sure the audio plays there. If the issue is only with Estraad, contact us to troubleshoot your issue.

#### I cant control volume in videos {#i-cant-control-volume-in-videos}

This is a known issue for the Safari browser and some mobile devices. Please use one of the recommended browsers as described in [welcome](welcome.md).

#### Loading the website says the device is not supported {#loading-the-website-says-the-device-is-not-supported}

Unfortunatley running a 3D environment in the browser means we have limited support for older devices and browsers. If you get this message, make sure you are using one of our supported browsers as described in [welcome](welcome.md). 

You need to be using a relatively modern (2013++) computer (or iPad, iPhone, etc) and a modern operating system such as Mac OS, Windows 10, or GNU/Linux with a browser environment supporting WebGL.
