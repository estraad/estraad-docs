Objects can be manipulated by for example scaling, rotating or moving them.

The object controls can be found by holding SPACE while holding the cursor over an object:

### Moving
Simply click on an object and drag with your mouse to move it.

### Scaling

Hold down SPACE for the object menu. Click and hold "Scale" and move your mouse to resize.

### Rotating

Hold down SPACE for the object menu. Click and hold "Rotate" and move your mouse to resize.

:::note

Hold SHIFT while rotating to rotate precisely.

### Locking

Hold down SPACE and click "Lock"/"Unlock" in the object menu.

Locking will do two very important things:
- Prevents moving the object accidentally.
- Makes the object persist in the room even after leaving.
