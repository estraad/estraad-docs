If the room permissions allow it, drawing mode lets you draw on almost all surfaces and objects in a room.

To enable drawing mode, click the Drawing Mode button in the toolbar.

When enabled, you can draw on things.

To make your drawing into an object, hold SPACE, hover the mouse over your drawing and click the "Create" button. This will turn your object into a 3D model.
