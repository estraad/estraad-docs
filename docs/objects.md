Objects are images, 3d models, videos, pdf documents, or audiofiles inserted into the 3D world.

## Creating an object {#creating-an-object}

If the room permissions permit you to spawn objects, you can do so in the following ways:

### Drag-and-drop {#drag-and-drop}

If a room permits creation of objects, you can drag-and-drop files into the webpage to upload them into the 3D room. An indication will show the uploading state. You may drag-and-drop multiple objects at the same time.

Please note that large video files may not work as they will require long upload time and reduce the performance of other participants in the room.

### Using tools {#using-tools}

The following tools are related to object creation:
- [Stickynotes](stickynotes.md)
- [Drawing mode](drawing)
